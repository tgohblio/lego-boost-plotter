# lego-boost-plotter
A simple python script using LEGO plotter made frome LEGO BOOST Creative Toolbox set 17101

The plotter is this one: https://robotics.benedettelli.com/lego-boost-image-plotter/ 
It's design is great, but the JavaScript that prints is not working well. It often fails to connect, and when it finallz connects, it often freezes, draw unwanted lines, randomlz disconnects etc.
That's why I wrote this simple Pythin script. It definitely should be tuned a bit and made more user friendly...

Example use: python draw.py image.png 2 1 (filename, strenght of the pen and test/real write - 0/1)
